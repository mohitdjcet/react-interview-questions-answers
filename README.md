A JavaScript function that returns React elements.

### 7. What is a class component?
A component defined with ES6 class that can manage its own state.

### 8. What are props in React?
Props are inputs to components passed as attributes.

### 9. What is state in React?
State is a local data storage that is mutable within the component.

### 16. What is Context API?
Allows global state sharing across components without prop drilling.

### 17. What is prop drilling?
Passing data through multiple layers of components manually.

### 18. What is React Router?
A routing library that enables single-page app navigation.

### 19. What is Redux?
A predictable state container for managing application-level state.

### 20. What are actions in Redux?
Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened.

### 21. What is a reducer?
A function that determines state changes in response to actions.

### 22. What is middleware in Redux?
Functions that intercept actions before they reach the reducer.

### 23. What is useReducer?

### 24. What is lazy loading in React?
Loading components only when needed to improve performance.

### 25. What is Suspense?
A component that shows a fallback until a lazy-loaded component finishes loading.

### 26. What is memoization in React?
Optimization technique to avoid expensive calculations by caching results.

### 27. What is React.memo?

A wrapper that checks for potential issues in development mode.

### 35. How to optimize performance?
Using memoization, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, and code splitting.

### 36. What are custom hooks?
Functions that use built-in React hooks to reuse component logic.

### 37. What is defaultProps?
An attribute used to set default values for props.

By using controlled or uncontrolled components with appropriate state or refs.

### 39. What is React Developer Tools?
A Chrome/Firefox extension to inspect and debug React components.

### 40. What is the difference between children and props?
